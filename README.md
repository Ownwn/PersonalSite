# Personal Site

---

A site I made to quickly access school links, along with my LLM wrapper. 
Rewritten from Svelte to React. Some of the code is a little old as this was the project that I first learned JS with.

### Learning Experiences
- General React state knowledge
- Client/server sides, backend with Cloudflare Functions
- Authentication using cookies
- Good UX designs, with me as the tester


### Tricky problems
- My cookie parsing was failing due to an extra cookie added by Cloudflare. This only occured on Safari, which led me down a bit of a red herring chase.
- CSS scoping. In React, CSS can leak out to other pages. Solved using css modules
